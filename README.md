# BarcodeScannerSwift
This is an iOS application developed using Swift and Xcode. It utilizes Apple's AVCapture to track for barcodes. Once one is found, a green box surrounds it, the phone vibrates, the live feed stops, and the string corresponding to the barcode is displayed in a UIAlertController.
